**Name 5 of 11 quality factors:**
Correctness
Reliablility
Efficiency
Integrity
Useablility
Maintainability
Testability
Flexibility 
Portability
Reusablility

**QC:** quaity control-*respondant* looking for or detecting.
**vs** 
**QA:** quality assurance-*preventative* avoiding issues in the futre. 

**The 5 perspectives of Quality:**
Transcendent- Looks
Product Based- Features needed
User Based- Fit for use
Development and Manufacturing based- requirements and standards
Value Based- within budget

**Game Lifecycle**
Design-Concept Phase
Prototype-Rough Draft
Alpha-Full Playthrough Major Milestone
Beta-Game is Basically Finished, Beta Testing Begins
Gold-Ready for Market

**Testing Process**
Define Test Objective- What requirements need to be met, strategy
Develop Test Plan-Document lays out with constraints etc.
Develop Test Cases-Break down test, result, and how, what are you looking for? ex: save file spits out save file
Execute Tests-Running Test Pass or Fail
Report Results-Documentation and Report of how to fix it and why it occurs

**TYPES OF GAME TESTING**

**WHITE BOX TESTING**
        Testing based on an analysis of internal workings, logic and structure of a piece of software. 
        Includes techniques such as testing a branch of code.

**BLACK BOX TESTING**
        Testing without knowledge of the internal workings of the item being tested. 
        Testing from a userâ€™s perspective. Tests are usually functional.

**COMPATIBILITY TESTING**
        Testing to ensure compatibility of an application or Web site with different browsers, OSs, and hardware platforms. Compatibility testing can be performed manually or can be driven by an automated functional or regression test suite.

**CONFORMANCE TESTING**
        Verifying implementation conformance to industry standards such as 508. Testing for quality factors such as portability, interoperability, and/or compatibility a standard defines.

**FUNCTIONAL TESTING**
        Validating an application/software/web site meets its specifications and correctly performs all its required functions. This entails a series of tests which perform a feature by feature validation of behavior, using a wide range of normal and erroneous input data. This can involve testing of the product's user interface, APIs, database management, security, installation, networking, etc. Testing can be performed on an automated or manual basis using black box or white box methodologies.

**NEGATIVE TESTING**
        Validating an application/software/web site to validate error conditions

**SMOKE TESTING**
        A quick-and-dirty test that the major functions of a piece of software work without bothering with finer details. This testing is usually done right after a new build is received into a new test environment.

**PERFORMANCE TESTING**
        Performance testing can be applied to understand your application or WWW site's scalability, or to benchmark the performance in an environment of third party products such as servers and middleware for potential purchase. This sort of testing is particularly useful to identify performance bottlenecks in high use applications. Performance testing generally involves an automated test suite as this allows easy simulation of a variety of normal, peak, and exceptional load conditions.

**STRESS TESTING**
        Testing conducted to evaluate a system or component at or beyond the limits of its specified requirements to determine the load under which it fails and how. A graceful degradation under load leading to non-catastrophic failure is the desired result. Often Stress Testing is performed using the same process as Performance Testing but employing a very high level of simulated load.

**LOAD TESTING**
        Load testing is a generic term covering Performance Testing and Stress Testing.

**REGRESSION TESTING**
        Similar in scope to a functional test, a regression test allows a consistent, repeatable validation of each new release of a product. Such testing ensures reported product defects have been corrected for each new release and that no new quality problems were introduced in the maintenance process. Though regression testing can be performed manually an automated test suite is often used to reduce the time and resources needed to perform the required testing.

**SYSTEM TESTING**
        Testing conducted on a complete, integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements. System testing falls within the scope of black box testing, and as such, should require no knowledge of the inner design of the code or logic.

**INTEGRATION TESTING**
        Testing in which modules are combined and tested as a group. Modules are typically code modules, individual applications, client and server applications on a network, etc. Integration Testing follows unit testing and precedes system testing.

**UNIT TESTING**
        Functional and reliability testing in an development environment. Producing tests for the behavior of components of a product to ensure their correct behavior prior to system integration. This testing is usually conducted by the developer or development team.

**ACCEPTANCE TESTING**
        Testing to verify a product meets customer specified requirements. A customer usually does this type of testing on a product that is developed externally.

**AUTOMATED TESTING**
        Utilizing a test tool to automate testing. Reduces the testing time but requires maintenance and knowledge of the tool by a QA tester.

**BALANCE TESTING**
            Testing to verify that gameplay is fair to both the human versus AI player, and single and multiplayer modes. Making sure easy level is not too easy and hard level is not too hard. Examples are testing weapons balance, and map balance.

**COMPATIBILITY TESTING**
            Same as above only on a game.

**COMPLIANCE TESTING**
            Testing to verify games follows some established guidelines before it is allowed to be sold in stores. Common compliance requirements are copyrighted brands and names are accompanied by their respective signs and certain warning message in regards to the memory card/hard drive formatting.

**LOCALIZATION TESTING**
            Testing to verify a game can be converted from one region to another usually involves translation. The same game can be played in US, Korea, Japan or Germany.

**PLAYTESTING**
            Comparable to a user acceptance test with users from the general public. Determining the fun factor, is the game entertaining and fun to play.

**USABILITY TESTING**
            Testing to verify the game is easy to use. Not easy as in difficulty level. The game is intuitive meaning user can figure out how to interact with other characters, how to aim, how to find your way and how to drive vehicles.
