Beta-Game is Basically Finished, Beta Testing Begins
Gold-Ready for Market

**Testing Process**
Define Test Objective- What requirements need to be met, strategy
Develop Test Plan-Document lays out with constraints etc.
Develop Test Cases-Break down test, result, and how, what are you looking for? ex: save file spits out save file
